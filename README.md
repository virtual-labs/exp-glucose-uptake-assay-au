### About the Experiment 

The Glucose Uptake Assay virtual experiment simulates the measurement of glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocyte cells using radioactively labeled 2-deoxy-D-glucose. It demonstrates how insulin and plant extracts influence glucose transporter translocation to the cell membrane, facilitating glucose entry. This assay is pivotal for studying insulin signaling and evaluating potential anti-diabetic compounds.â€‹
